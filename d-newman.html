                            <p class="mb-0">The Dallard-Newman House at 192 Kelley St. is one of the only surviving historic African American homes in the Valley. 137 years after its construction, the house is undergoing rennovations to become the city’s first museum of Black history.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0">Despite segregation developing following the Civil War, a shift toward freedom for African Americans and rising economic power for people of color allowed African American ownership of the land that would soon hold the Dallard-Newman House. This land became the Newtown Community in present-day downtown Harrisonburg.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0">Susan Zurbrigg, a board member of the Northeast Neighborhood Association (NENA), said countless communities named “Newtown” sprouted up throughout the United States as safe havens in the late 1860s — “new towns” built from scratch after the Civil War — for African Americans and formerly enslaved people to flourish. Harrisonburg’s Newtown gave the Black community a place to thrive, she said.</p> 
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0"><img src="Ambrose_Dallard.jpg" class="pl-img" width="250px" style="float: right;">Twin brothers and former slaves Ambrose and Reuben Dallard built the Dallard-Newman House in the Newtown Community in 1885. Ambrose and his wife, Harriet Graves Dallard, had two daughters, Lucy and Mary. The two married into the Cochran and Newman families, joining them to the property. The house was first owned by Lucy Dallard and her husband Charles Cochran, and once the two left Newtown, Mary Carlotta Newman and her husband George A. Newman Sr. moved into the home with their fourteen children. Mary died at the age of 103 in 2015 and had spent the duration of her life in the home. Her death ended the 140-year family-ownership of the home.</p>

                            <p class="mb-0">The historic Newtown Community is now quite different from what it once was, largely due to the United States’ “Urban Renewal” project in the 1950s and ‘60s. Harrisonburg received funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, allowing the city to declare eminent domain over homes and businesses in the northeast part of Harrisonburg — namely, Newtown. </p> 
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0">Many descendants of enslaved people still lived in this area at the time, so this project <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/renewal/#view=0/0/1&viz=map&city=harrisonburgVA&loc=13/38.4493/-78.8988">led to the displacement of dozens of families in Newtown</a> . Homes turned into businesses and parking lots, and more than 60% of the demolition directly impacted the Black community, Zurbrigg said. According to the <a href="https://www.nenava.org/history.html">NENA website</a> , the urban renewal tore the “heart out of a Black community and reduced them to rubble.” </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0">“I do think Harrisonburg has changed a lot, and that’s a good thing,” Zurbrigg said, referencing her 22 years as a JMU professor. “But it also hasn’t necessarily gone back into its past to reconcile it, to really make sense of it, and to then correct it.”</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0">The Dallard-Newman House is one of the only standing houses that survived the Urban Renewal. That, Zurbrigg said, is just one aspect of why it’s so important to preserve.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0"><img src="Dallard_Newman_House.jpg" class="pl-img" width="350px" style="float: left;">“It’s a humble house, but it’s a beautiful house,” Zurbrigg said with a smile. “It has this wonderful energy…it feels like a sort of anchoring for the community.”</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0">NENA was originally formed as a neighborhood watch program in the early 2000s as a response to the rising crime rate in the northeast part of the city. It was founded by Karen Thomas, a resident of the area. As the crime rate dropped, the focus of NENA became beautifying and preserving the city.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0">NENA established a goal: purchase the Dallard-Newman House and transform it into a museum for African American history in Harrisonburg. Zurbrigg was tasked with acquiring funds – and in collaboration with the Harrisonburg Community Foundation, NENA raised $50,000 to purchase the Dallard-Newman House in 2018. The price of the house could not be disclosed. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0">The state legislature approved a $250,000 budget for the renovations in mid-2021. Construction began on the house on Oct. 31, 2022, to transform it into a museum to honor Harrisonburg’s African American heritage. Their hope, Zurbrigg said, is to open it as an archival space with interactive educational elements such as poetry readings, art exhibitions and community engagement opportunities.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0">Rocky Moulton, Nielsen Builders’ project manager for the Dallard-Newman House, said the first major step in phase one of construction was to break away part of the existing foundation to lift the house on stilts to construct a new foundation. The builders have already completed the concrete foundation and are preparing to start the masonry foundation walls. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0">Other than the original stone foundation, Moulton said, builders are working to salvage as much of the house as possible.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0"><img src="Dallard-Newman House Permit Drawing Set_Page_3.jpg" class="pl-img" width="450px" style="float: right;">“We were wondering whether during excavation we would discover any historic artifacts that we could turn over to the Northeast Neighborhood Association,” Moulton said. “We did find a glass bottle that dates back to about the 1890s.”</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0">This phase of work is expected to take four months from start to finish, Moulton said, and Thomas said she would like to get interior renovations underway and completed by the end of 2023.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0">“The completion of our current phase is likely to be a catalyst for even more interest in the project as the community senses the progress, and the potential for the house as a museum,” Moulton said. “I think once it is fully renovated the community will be proud of what it represents, and I anticipate that it will attract lots of people who are interested in its history.”</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="mb-0">Zurbrigg said creating a space for the appreciation of African American culture and heritage is a step in the right direction for the community.</p>
